>    The Ophis project started on a lark back in 2001.  My graduate
    studies required me to learn Perl and Python, and I'd been playing
    around with Commodore 64 emulators in my spare time, so I decided
    to learn both languages by writing a simple cross-assembler for
    the 6502 chip the C-64 used in both.
  </P
><P
>    The Perl version was quickly abandoned, but the Python one slowly
    grew in scope and power over the years, and by 2005 was a very
    powerful, flexible macro assembler that saw more use than I'd
    expect.  In 2007 I finally got around to implementing the last few
    features I really wanted and polishing it up for general release.
  </P
><P
>    Part of that process has been formatting the various little
    tutorials and references I'd created into a single, unified
    document&#8212;the one you are now reading.

>      It's actually a kind of a horrific pun.  See, I was using Python
      at the time, and one of the things I had been hoping to do with
      the assembler was to produce working Apple II
      programs.  <SPAN

      as the actual <I

>name</I
> of the serpent in the
      Garden of Eden.  So, Pythons, snakes, and stories involving
      really old Apples all combined to name the assembler.
